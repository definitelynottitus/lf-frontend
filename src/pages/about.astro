    <h1 class="mission-statement">Our mission is to integrate the climate into our everyday food choices.</h1>
    <p>
        The global food system is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for up to
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216">
            a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.
        </a>  
        That is why our food choices matter when it comes to reducing global emissions. 
        We envision a world where we produce, consume and compost food in a sustainable manner. 
    </p>
    <h2>The Why</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>Impact of Food Choices on the Climate</h3>
        <p>Food production accounts for over a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, 
            and half of the worldâ€™s habitable (ice and desert-free) land is used for agriculture. 
            The urgency of the climate crisis and the significant impact that food has on greenhouse 
            gas emissions means that food services and consumers have an important role to play in their 
            food choices, by creating demand for less carbon-intensive foods. By providing transparency on 
            the carbon emissions of food by using menu labels, consumers will be able to 
            make more climate-informed choices. A 2020 survey found that consumers were in support of 
            carbon labelling on products across all countries, with two-thirds of consumers saying they 
            think it is a good idea  
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.carbontrust.com/our-work-and-impact/guides-reports-and-tools/product-carbon-footprint-labelling-consumer-research-2020">
                (The Carbon Trust, 2020).
            </a>              
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe the value of carbon labelling can 
            extend to restaurant menus too. Our vision is that the resulting shift in demand away from carbon-intensive 
            foods will lead to food services offering more low-carbon alternatives. Other restaurants around the 
            world are starting to put climate labels on their food, such as Chipotle and Just Salad. Now is 
            the perfect time to get ahead!
