            The global food system is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for up to
            <a target="_blank" href={link} class="no-underline font-bold text-gray-100">
                a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.
            </a>  
            That is why our food choices matter when it comes to reducing global emissions. 
            We envision a world where we produce, consume and compost food in a sustainable manner.

        <h2>The Why</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Impact of Food Choices on the Climate</h3>
            <p>Food production accounts for over 
                <a href={link} target="_blank">a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>, 
                and half of the world’s habitable (ice and desert-free) land is used for agriculture. 
                The urgency of the climate crisis and the significant impact that food has on greenhouse 
                gas emissions means that food services and consumers have an important role to play in their 
                food choices, by creating demand for less carbon-intensive foods. By providing transparency on 
                the carbon emissions of food by using menu labels, consumers will be able to 
                make more climate-informed choices. A 2020 survey found that consumers were in support of 
                carbon labelling on products across all countries, with two-thirds of consumers saying they 
                think it is a good idea  
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.carbontrust.com/our-work-and-impact/guides-reports-and-tools/product-carbon-footprint-labelling-consumer-research-2020">
                    (The Carbon Trust, 2020).

                We believe the value of carbon labelling can 
                extend to restaurant menus too. Our vision is that the resulting shift in demand away from carbon-intensive 
                foods will lead to food services offering more low-carbon alternatives. Other restaurants around the 
                world are starting to put climate labels on their food, such as

                and <a href="https://justsalad.com/carbonlabel" target="_blank">Just Salad</a>. Now is 
                the perfect time to get ahead!

            <h3>Importance of Sustainability in Business</h3>
            <p>Incorporating sustainability into your business model isn’t only great for the environment - 
                it is also becoming widely accepted as a necessity for long-term business success. Today’s 
                consumer wants to know where their food comes from, how it was produced, and, increasingly, 
                what sustainability factors were included in the process. According to the 
                <a href="https://nielseniq.com/global/en/" target="_blank">Nielsen Company</a>, 
                74% of Millennials and 72% of Gen-Z consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products 
                and services.
            </p>

            <p>
                By implementing climate labels, we can help your business turn sustainability into a viable brand 
                strategy for more sustainability-minded audiences, increasing your presence in the community, and 
                improving long-term sales. With sufficient foresight, these can become opportunities to lead by 
                example and become trend setters in the industry. Responding to heightened social, governmental, and 
                consumer attention on the broader impact of the environment nowadays demonstrates how a more sustainable 
                business model is a competitive advantage. It’s a win-win for you, our community, and for the environment.
